This is a repository that I'm currently working on to **learn** and **create useful resources** for **LLD (Low-Level Design)** and **OOD (Object-Oriented Design)** to help with **interview preparation** and **real-world system design**.

---

## What is LLD?

> Low-Level Design (LLD) is all about how your code is actually structured behind the scenes.
> You take the big idea (high-level design) and break it into small pieces — like classes, objects, and how they interact.
>
> It's where you use things like OOP, design principles, and design patterns to plan how features will be coded before you even start writing the code.
>
> Think of it as creating the **blueprint for your code** to make sure it's clean, reusable, and easy to maintain.

## Fundamental Concepts in LLD

- **OOP**

  - [🔗 Basic Principles of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)](https://dev.to/ahadalireach/basic-principles-of-object-oriented-programming-oop-544l)
  - [🔗 OOP Concepts + 150+ Interview Questions (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ahadalireach/oop.concepts.interview.questions)

- **Design Principles** _(currently learning)_
- **UML (Unified Modeling Language)**
- **Design Patterns**
- **Case Studies & Practice Problems** _(coming soon)_

> 📌 _This content will be continuously updated as I learn and explore more._
